- Motif Convolution / MotifNet: motif-induced adjacencies (replace A).
- Graphlet features & kernels: static descriptors; not message-level.
- Higher-order GNNs (k-GNN, GSN): explicit subgraphs; heavy compute.
- Our angle: precomputed motif roles as **live signals** in message passing
  (features, gates, or adjacency mixing) with HiPerXplorer backend.
